"""Daytime-window parsing and containment for the scheduler (WP 3.5).

Plan §7 Phase 3: "Configurable cron window (e.g. 09:00-17:00, every 3 h)".
This module is the *pure* half of that: string -> ``ScheduleWindow``, and
"is this moment inside the window". No database, no threads, no clock of its
own — everything is a function of the arguments, which is what makes the
scheduler's decisions testable without waiting for real time to pass.

Kept in its own module (rather than inside ``vault_api/scheduler.py``) for one
concrete reason: ``vault_api/config.py`` validates ``VAULT_SCHEDULE_WINDOW`` at
**startup**, so it needs the parser — and ``scheduler.py`` imports
``config.Settings``. A parser living in ``scheduler.py`` would make that a
circular import.

Format
------
``HH:MM-HH:MM``, zero-padded, 24-hour, e.g. ``09:00-17:00``. Whitespace around
the value and around either side of the ``-`` is tolerated
(``" 09:00 - 17:00 "``); everything else is rejected loudly rather than
guessed at.

Semantics, stated once so the rest of the codebase can just point here:

* **Start inclusive, end exclusive** — ``09:00-17:00`` is active from 09:00:00
  up to but not including 17:00:00. (Second/microsecond precision is ignored:
  containment is decided on whole minutes, so 16:59:59 is inside.)
* **Overnight windows are supported.** ``22:00-06:00`` (end earlier than
  start) means 22:00 through midnight *and* midnight through 06:00 — one
  contiguous night. This is deliberate: "prefill while nobody is gaming" is
  the natural homelab window and it crosses midnight. It is expressed as the
  union ``[start, 24:00) ∪ [00:00, end)``; no calendar day is tracked, so the
  window simply recurs every night.
* **``24:00`` is accepted as the END value only**, meaning "end of day". This
  is what makes an always-on window expressible: ``00:00-24:00``. As a *start*
  value it is rejected (a window starting at end-of-day is empty).
* **start == end is rejected**, e.g. ``09:00-09:00``. It reads as either "zero
  minutes" or "the whole day" depending on who you ask; refusing it and
  pointing at ``00:00-24:00`` removes the ambiguity instead of picking one
  silently.
* **Server-local time.** A moment is classified by its own wall-clock hour and
  minute, so callers must pass a datetime already in the timezone the window
  is meant to describe. ``vault_api/scheduler.py`` passes an *aware*
  local-time datetime; see its module docstring for the timezone and DST
  notes.
