"""Manifest-oracle endpoints (WP 3.9, ADR-0006 decision 4).

``GET /v1/oracle/{appid}``     — the stored view: pre-emptive stale badge,
                                 depot list (including for a game that has
                                 never been cached), open beta branches.
``POST /v1/oracle/{appid}/refresh`` — ask the oracle now.
``DELETE /v1/oracle/{appid}``  — forget what it said.

Auth is attached at the router level (secure-by-default pattern, see
api/README.md "Auth") — every route added here is authenticated automatically.

**Two things this router deliberately does NOT do.**

It does not run on a schedule. Wiring the oracle into the WP 3.5 scheduler or
the job worker would make an outbound third-party request a background,
invisible event on a box whose operator may never have read this file; refresh
stays an explicit call for now (api/README.md records this as the follow-up).

It does not fail. ``POST .../refresh`` answers ``200`` with ``ok: false`` and
a reason when the oracle is unreachable or answered garbage, and ``200`` with
``enabled: false`` when the feature is off. Neither is a client error — the
client did nothing wrong — and turning a flaky third party into 5xx responses
would be exactly the fragility ADR-0006's fail-soft rule exists to avoid. The
only error code here is ``422`` for an ``appid < 1``.
