"""Scheduler endpoint (WP 3.5): ``GET /v1/schedule``.

**This module itself has no write verb — that claim used to be stronger and
is now corrected (reviewer should-fix S3, 2026-08-18 review round).** Through
WP 3.5 there really was no way to change the window, interval, staleness
bound or (later, WP 4d) the cached-apps sweep mode at runtime short of
editing the environment and restarting. Since the settings-API work package
(ADR-0009), ``PATCH /v1/settings`` IS that write path for every field this
endpoint reports except the bookkeeping ones (``last_sweep_at``,
``last_sweep_targets``, ``last_sweep_enqueued``, ``next_eligible_at``) — see
``vault_api/settings_store.py`` and api/README.md "Persisted settings". This
router stays read-only, but "vault-api has no config-write API" is no longer
true of the system as a whole, and this docstring must not be the one place
that still says otherwise.

What ``GET /v1/schedule`` answers is "what WILL the scheduler do, and what
did it last do", which is the question you actually have when a game did not
get updated overnight — always the EFFECTIVE, override-resolved
configuration (``settings_store.effective_settings``), never the raw
env/default snapshot, so a recent ``PATCH`` is reflected here immediately.

Auth is attached at the router level (secure-by-default pattern, see
api/README.md "Auth").
