"""Cache-event sweep status (WP 3.11, ADR-0008): ``GET /v1/stats``.

Read-only, and small on purpose. It exists because without it the entire
event-sweep feature is **invisible**: the sweeper is a background thread
reading a file nobody looks at, and the three questions an operator actually
has — "is it reading anything?", "is it throwing lines away?", "is it able to
rotate the log?" — would otherwise only be answerable by grepping container
logs or opening the SQLite file.

Two of those questions matter enough to be worth an endpoint on their own:

* ``lines_skipped_total`` climbing means vault-core is writing something this
  vault-api does not understand (a format change, or a truncated write). The
  sweep degrades quietly and correctly in that case — which is exactly why it
  needs a counter, or "quietly" wins.
* ``truncate_denied_count`` climbing means the sweeper is reading the event log
  but is not permitted to rotate it, so the file grows without bound. In the
  shipped containers that is the *default* situation (vault-api runs as uid
  101, the log belongs to vault-core's nginx user), so this is a number an
  operator will really need — see ``event_sweep.maybe_truncate``.

Auth is attached at the router level (secure-by-default pattern, see
api/README.md "Auth").
