"""Shared FastAPI dependencies (request-scoped resources).

Kept separate from db.py so db.py stays framework-agnostic (plain sqlite3
helpers, importable without FastAPI installed) while routers get a normal
FastAPI ``Depends`` dependency.

Why routers get an *opener* instead of a connection (WP 1.4 fix)
---------------------------------------------------------------
WP 1.3's version was a sync generator dependency: open a connection, yield it
to the endpoint, close it in a ``finally``. That is the shape every FastAPI
tutorial shows, and under concurrency it **segfaulted the interpreter** —
reproduced repeatedly on Windows/CPython 3.12 as "Windows fatal exception:
access violation" while hammering the API with parallel requests.

Measured mechanism (not a guess — captured by wrapping ``sqlite3.Connection``
in a subclass that recorded every overlapping use of one connection):

    thread A (anyio worker): conn.execute("BEGIN IMMEDIATE")  <- blocked on the
                                                                 write lock,
                                                                 GIL released
    thread B (event loop):   FastAPI's AsyncExitStack unwinds the dependency
                             -> the old get_db's finally -> conn.close()

Closing a connection while another thread is inside ``sqlite3_step`` on it is a
use-after-free at the C level; sqlite's serialized threading mode protects the
*database*, not CPython's per-connection objects. The window opens whenever the
exit stack unwinds while the body is still running, and write-lock contention
(``PRAGMA busy_timeout``) makes the body block long enough for it to matter.

The fix is structural: **the connection never leaves the thread that created it
and never outlives the endpoint body.** The dependency hands the endpoint a
zero-argument opener; the endpoint does ``with open_db() as conn:``, so open,
use and close all happen inside the single ``run_in_threadpool`` call that runs
the body. Nothing else can close it — and ``check_same_thread`` is back at its
safe default (see ``db.get_connection``), so a future regression is a loud
``ProgrammingError`` instead of a crash.
