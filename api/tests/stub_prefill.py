"""A fake SteamPrefill executable for the tests. No Steam login, no network.

The real binary cannot be used in tests: it needs a Steam account, a running
vault-core, and real bandwidth. This module generates a small executable that
behaves like it in the ways the runner depends on:

- it reads its app selection from ``Config/selectedAppsToPrefill.json`` next to
  itself — the verified non-interactive selection mechanism (see
  ``vault_api/prefill.py``), so the tests prove the runner actually uses it;
- it writes fake depot chunk files into a cache root, so the depot-diff
  attribution has something real to observe;
- it can optionally drop a synthetic SteamPrefill manifest ``.bin`` file into
  a configured directory (WP 3.2's worker-ingestion end-to-end test), using
  caller-supplied raw bytes (hex-encoded in the control file) rather than a
  second protobuf encoder — the one in ``tests/test_manifests.py`` is reused;
- it can reproduce the failure modes that matter: a non-zero exit, the verbatim
  not-logged-in output, and a hang.

``make_stub`` writes a platform-appropriate launcher (a ``.cmd`` shim on
Windows, a ``sh`` shim elsewhere) that runs the stub with the *current*
interpreter, so nothing has to be on PATH. Both were verified to pass argv
through, hand the child an EOF stdin, and propagate the exit code.

Known shim artifact: on Windows, ``terminate()`` on a ``.cmd`` kills cmd.exe but
not the python grandchild (measured). The real SteamPrefill is a single-process
executable, so this only affects the stub — hence the bounded hang below.
