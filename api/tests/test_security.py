# scaffolded SPA views and their nested-path variants) are real FastAPI
# `APIRoute`s — unlike the old catch-all `Mount("/")` this replaced, they DO
# carry a `.dependant` and so ARE picked up by the route walk below. They
# are intentionally public (WP 4a.1 brief: "Router auth must NOT cover
# static assets; the app itself authenticates API calls with the key the
# user enters") — listed here explicitly, generated from
# `webui._SPA_ROUTES` rather than hand-duplicated, so this set can't drift
# from the one that actually decides which paths are mounted.
