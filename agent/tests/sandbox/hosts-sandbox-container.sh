# WP 2.3 sandbox verification - runs INSIDE a throwaway container, as root.
#
# This is the end-to-end proof that `vault-agent hosts` does the right thing
# against a REAL system hosts file (the container's own /etc/hosts), not just
# against synthetic fixtures:
#
#   apply -> the hostname actually resolves to the cache IP (getent)
#   remove -> resolution is gone AND the file is byte-identical to before
#   non-root -> a clean permission-denied message with the sudo hint, and the
#               file is untouched
#
# It is deliberately re-runnable and self-contained. NEVER run it outside a
# throwaway container: it modifies /etc/hosts.
#
# Driver: agent/tests/sandbox/run-hosts-sandbox.sh (host side).
