.SYNOPSIS
WP 2.3 - Windows verification of `vault-agent hosts` against SANDBOX hosts
fixtures.

.DESCRIPTION
Exercises the parts of hosts mode that only real Windows can answer: CRLF
preservation on a genuine Windows-shaped hosts file, and what os.Rename does
against ACL-restricted files (the evidence behind the in-place write fallback
documented in agent/go/hostsfile/write.go).

THE REAL SYSTEM HOSTS FILE IS NEVER WRITTEN. It is only hashed, at the start
and at the end, and the run fails if those hashes differ. Every fixture lives
under -LabDir.

No administrator rights are required: the ACL cases are built on files this
user owns, using icacls DENY entries against the user's own account.

.PARAMETER Exe
Path to a windows/amd64 vault-agent.exe. Cross-compile it with:
  CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o vault-agent.exe ./cmd/vault-agent

.PARAMETER LabDir
Throwaway directory for the fixtures. Created if missing, and REMOVED again
when the run ends (including on failure) unless -KeepLab is given. Sections 2
and 3 leave DENY ACEs behind, so the cleanup resets the ACLs first -- without
that, the directory cannot be deleted from Explorer without a fight.

.PARAMETER KeepLab
Keep the lab directory for inspection. You will need
`icacls <LabDir> /reset /T /C /Q` before you can delete it yourself.

.\hosts-windows-sandbox.ps1 -Exe C:\tmp\vault-agent.exe
