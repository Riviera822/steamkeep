// Package hostsfile manages EXACTLY ONE marker-delimited block in a
// system hosts file (WP 2.3, plan §3 "optional hosts-file mode" and §10
// deployment mode 3):
//
//	# BEGIN steamvault-agent (managed block - do not edit inside)
//	192.168.1.50 lancache.steamcontent.com
//	# END steamvault-agent
//
// The hostname is not ours to choose: `lancache.steamcontent.com` is
// hardcoded by Valve in the Steam client and lives on Valve's own
// steamcontent.com domain — it is the client's built-in cache-discovery
// interface, not a LanCache-project dependency (plan §3). Pointing it at
// vault-core makes the client use the cache with no DNS server involved
// at all.
//
// # Why this package is written the way it is
//
// This code modifies a file the ENTIRE machine's name resolution depends
// on, on a user's own PC, with administrator rights. Every design choice
// below favors auditability and reversibility over cleverness:
//
//   - Exactly one block, delimited by markers. Nothing outside the markers
//     is ever read for meaning or rewritten. Splicing happens on BYTE
//     OFFSETS (never "split into lines, modify, join") so the bytes before
//     and after the block are carried over verbatim — line endings,
//     trailing whitespace, exotic encodings in unrelated lines and all.
//   - Every mutation writes <path>.steamvault.bak FIRST, containing the
//     exact pre-mutation bytes. If the backup cannot be written, no
//     mutation happens at all (fail closed).
//   - A hosts file whose markers do not form exactly one well-formed
//     BEGIN..END pair is NEVER touched — not by Apply, not by Remove.
//     We cannot identify our own block, so any edit would be a guess.
//   - An entry for the same hostname OUTSIDE our block blocks Apply. The
//     system resolver takes the FIRST match, so silently appending a
//     second entry could produce a block that is present, correct-looking,
//     and completely ineffective.
//   - No elevation logic. See the ElevationHint doc comment.
//
// # Platform scope
//
// Implemented platform-neutrally; Windows remains the documented primary
// target (plan §10 mode 3). The plan's original Windows-only rationale
// ("the Linux/Steam Deck client does not perform this lookup") was
// disproven by Phase 0 WP 0.6: the CURRENT Linux client DOES perform
// lancache discovery (3574 requests through the cache — plan §7's Linux
// checkbox). Hosts mode is therefore useful on Linux/SteamOS too, and
// nothing in this package is Windows-specific beyond the default path and
// the elevation hint wording.
