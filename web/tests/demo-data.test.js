/**
 * Headless tests for web/js/demo-data.js (WP 4a.2 review blocker B2).
 *
 * demo-data.js imports only errors.js (no `window`, `document` or `fetch`)
 * so it runs directly in bare Node — no fake environment needed, unlike
 * api.js or store.js.
 *
 * Covers the review's B2 finding: the previous DELETE /v1/cache/{appid}
 * handler (a) returned bare id lists instead of the real CacheDeletionOut
 * shape, and (b) deleted a depot that was still shared with a currently
 * CACHED co-owner — the exact thing ADR-0003's shared-depot protection
 * exists to prevent — and billed its bytes as freed.
 *
 * Run: node --test "web/tests/*.test.js"   (see web/tests/README.md)
