# web/tests

Headless tests for the `web/` no-build vanilla SPA. No dependencies, no
bundler, no browser — plain ES modules run directly by Node's built-in test
runner (`node:test`, confirmed available: `node --version` reported
v24.12.0 on this machine when WP 4a.2 was implemented).

## Run

```
node --test "web/tests/*.test.js"
```

**Note (measured on this machine, Node v24.12.0, Windows):** `node --test
web/tests` (a bare directory, no glob) fails hard with a CJS
`MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `web\tests` instead of discovering the files inside
it — Node's own default-pattern directory walk did not trigger for an
explicit directory argument here. The explicit glob above is the form that
actually works; use it, not the bare-directory form some `node --test` docs
show.

Run a single file directly the same way:

```
node --test web/tests/backoff.test.js
```

## Scope

- `backoff.test.js` — exponential backoff growth, cap, jitter bounds
  (including that the zero-floor is load-bearing, not just coincidentally
  satisfied), reset (`web/js/backoff.js`).
- `errors.test.js` — `classifyHttpStatus` across all six `ERROR_KINDS`
  (`web/js/errors.js`).
- `diff-utils.test.js` — the generic `diffByKey` list differ used by both
  the notification differ and the polling store
  (`web/js/diff-utils.js`).
- `notifications.test.js` — the client-side notification differ: every
  event type (`job_finished`, `job_failed`, `update_ready`,
  `bypass_suspected`, `bypass_resolved`), the no-change case, the
  first-poll case (must never fire a notification storm), the "stale
  requires cache content" invariant, and that an item aging out of a
  bounded list (e.g. `GET /v1/jobs?limit=20`) fires no event
  (`web/js/notifications.js`).
- `store.test.js` — the pure scheduling-decision helpers exported from
  `web/js/store.js` (`hasActiveJob`, `nextJobsIntervalMs`).
- `store-poll-loop.test.js` — the timer/in-flight orchestration in
  `web/js/store.js` (`ResourceLoop`), using a fake `document` object (only
  `hidden`/`addEventListener`/`removeEventListener` — `store.js` never
  touches more than that) and a manually-gated fetcher. No jsdom, no real
  browser: `store.js` only reads `document` lazily inside functions, never
  at module load, so a plain object stand-in is enough. Regression
  coverage for review blocker B1 (a nudge racing an in-flight poll used to
  fork a second, permanently duplicating timer chain and double-fire every
  notification).
- `demo-data.test.js` — `web/js/demo-data.js`'s request routing: the exact
  `CacheDeletionOut` response shape, ADR-0003 shared-depot protection
  (`DELETE /v1/cache/{appid}` skips a depot still cached by another game,
  frees it once every co-owner is uncached), 404/409 cases, all-or-nothing
  `POST /v1/prefill` body validation, and that a cancelled job settles to
  `'cancelled'` and stays there rather than continuing to tick toward
  `'done'`. This module imports only `errors.js` — no `window`, `document`
  or `fetch` — so it runs in bare Node with no fake environment at all.

`web/js/api.js` is the one module NOT covered here: exercising its real
`request()` path meaningfully needs a `fetch`/`localStorage`-capable
environment, and WP 4a.2's DoD is scoped to the differ and the backoff
math. Its one pure export, `classifyHttpStatus`, is re-exported from
`errors.js` and IS covered, by `errors.test.js`.
