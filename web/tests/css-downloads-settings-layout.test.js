/**
 * Downloads/Settings desktop layout (WP 4e.5, D-15) — structural CSS pins.
 *
 * The problem, `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md`'s Phase 4e section: Downloads and
 * Settings were the last two views that "just stretch" — they inherited
 * `.view-root`'s BP-L width (`--w-wall`, 960-2000px, the Library grid's own
 * cap) with no content-shape review of their own. Both are, top to bottom,
 * ROWS (job cards, queue rows, history rows) or a linear FORM (label/input/
 * caption fields) — never tiles that benefit from more columns — so the fix
 * is a capped, centred reading column at `--w-text` (unchanged, 760px from
 * BP-M up), not a new token and not a multi-column arrangement. Full
 * per-view inventory and the reasons a multi-column/hybrid layout was
 * considered and rejected for each view live in `docs/WORKPACKAGES.md`'s
 * D-15 entry and in `css/app.css`'s own comment on the rule this file pins.
 *
 * Same posture as `css-layout-foundation.test.js`/`css-overlay-geometry.
 * test.js`: no jsdom/browser in `web/tests/` (see this directory's README),
 * so this is a structural/value pin over the CSS source text, not a real
 * layout measurement — self-contained parsing utilities, not imported from
 * either sibling file, matching this suite's existing per-file convention.
