/**
 * Cross-language drift guard (2026-08-22, ADR-0014 fix round): `web/js/
 * demo-data.js` cannot import `api/vault_api/config.py`'s Python constants
 * (this suite runs under plain Node — no cross-language plumbing exists,
 * and this file deliberately does not invent any), but it CAN read that
 * module's source as plain text, the same "structural static analysis of
 * source text" technique `css-hygiene.test.js` already uses for CSS/JS.
 *
 * Why this test exists: `demo-data.js`'s `SETTINGS_BASE.auto_gc`/
 * `.sweep_include_cached` fixture rows shipped with `"off"`/`false` for
 * months, which was correct — until ADR-0014 (2026-08-22) flipped
 * `config.py`'s `DEFAULT_AUTO_GC`/`DEFAULT_SWEEP_INCLUDE_CACHED` to
 * `"execute"`/`true` and the fixture was not updated in the same change,
 * silently teaching a wrong default on exactly the surface used for demo
 * screenshots (docs/LEARNINGS.md: "demo fixtures are a shipped surface").
 * This test makes that class of drift loud on every `node --test` run
 * instead of quiet until the next person happens to compare the two files
 * by hand.
 *
 * **Two DIFFERENT failure modes, two DIFFERENT correct fixes (review round
 * 1, S3) — do not conflate them:**
 *
 *   1. **Value drift**: the regex below still matches config.py just fine,
 *      but resolves to a DIFFERENT value than `demo-data.js`'s exported
 *      `CONFIG_DEFAULT_AUTO_GC`/`CONFIG_DEFAULT_SWEEP_INCLUDE_CACHED`. This
 *      is the ADR-0014 case this guard exists for — the fix belongs in
 *      `demo-data.js`'s exported constants, never in this file's regexes.
 *   2. **Grammar drift**: the regex below does NOT match config.py at all —
 *      an innocent reformatting (a type annotation, single quotes instead
 *      of double, the literal inlined directly instead of through the
 *      `AUTO_GC_*` indirection) changed the SHAPE of the assignment without
 *      changing its meaning. This is NOT a case where `demo-data.js` is
 *      wrong, and the previous version of this file's error message
 *      ("has it been renamed?") wrongly pointed the reader at editing
 *      `demo-data.js` regardless of which of these two happened — the one
 *      fix it explicitly forbade (updating the regex here) is exactly the
 *      correct one for THIS failure mode. Each assertion below reports
 *      which of the two it hit, and only failure mode 1 says "edit
 *      demo-data.js"; failure mode 2 says to update the regex/extractor in
 *      THIS file instead.
