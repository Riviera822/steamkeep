/**
 * Client-side notification differ (WP 4a.2).
 *
 * docs/design/vault-app-mockup-NOTES.md, round 5 "Notifications are a poll,
 * not a push" (binding, frozen design source):
 *
 *   "v1 has no push channel; the real app derives these by polling
 *   GET /v1/jobs, GET /v1/games and GET /v1/clients and diffing against the
 *   previous poll (a finished job -> "cached", a game that turned stale ->
 *   "update available", a client that reports games but never hits the
 *   cache -> bypass warning). No new endpoint, no websocket, no
 *   server-held notification store."
 *
 * Plus job *Failures*, called out separately in the bell panel's own list
 * ("finished downloads (Cached), Update ready items, cache-bypass Warnings,
 * and job Failures").
 *
 * Event taxonomy shipped here (mapped to the NOTES sections above):
 *   - job_finished    <- "a finished job -> cached"
 *   - job_failed      <- "job Failures"
 *   - update_ready    <- "a game that turned stale -> update available"
 *   - bypass_suspected <- "a client... -> bypass warning"
 *   - bypass_resolved  <- symmetric counterpart of bypass_suspected, added
 *     per docs/LEARNINGS.md ("Transition detectors: persist state changes
 *     in BOTH directions... or enabling an event later fires falsely on
 *     first sight"). Not literally named in the NOTES bell-panel list, but
 *     the same transition-detector class as bypass_suspected — see the WP
 *     4a.2 report for why it is included. A UI that only ever shows the
 *     "suspected" half would have no way to tell "still bypassing" from
 *     "fixed the DNS setup last week" without this.
 *
 * Every function here is PURE (no fetch, no DOM, no clock reads) so the
 * full taxonomy is unit-testable headless (web/tests/notifications.test.js)
 * including the two invariants the DoD calls out by name:
 *   - the FIRST poll (no previous snapshot at all) must never fire a
 *     notification storm for data that was already true before the app
 *     opened;
 *   - a poll with no real change must produce zero events.

 * are terminal and the backend never rewrites a terminal job's status (see
 * "What a cancelled or paused prefill does NOT do" / "the outcome is what
 * actually happened; it is not rewritten"), so this set only matters for
 * distinguishing a genuine transition from a re-fetch of unchanged data —

 * `stale` value yet ("apps.status gains no new values", WP 3.12; the

 * separate, not-bulk-pollable field). This function is written against the
 * NOTES' documented contract ("a game that turned stale") so it needs no
 * change the day a `stale` status (or equivalent field) ships — see NOTES
 * open question 3, "does Phase 4 ship with three badges and gain orange
 * later". Until then it is correct and simply never fires, which is the
 * right behaviour for a field that does not exist yet, not a bug.
 *
 * **"Stale" requires cache content — frozen invariant (NOTES round 5,
 * finding 6: "'Stale' (and 'cached') require cache content — a status
 * rule, not a cosmetic").** A game can only be Update ready if it has
 * bytes on the cache to update; an empty app is Not cached, never Stale.
 * `GET /v1/games` is documented as never violating this server-side, but
 * this differ enforces it independently on the client too rather than
 * trusting the field blindly — the same "fail toward the safer reading"
 * posture as the bypass/job guards elsewhere in this file, and cheap
 * insurance against a future server bug shipping a stale flag on a
 * zero-byte app.
