/**
 * Pure presentation logic for `GET /v1/schedule` (WP 4d-web — closing the
 * "Phase 4a UI switch remains open" gap docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md's Phase 4d
 * entry names).
 *
 * `sweep_cached_gc_risk` is already computed server-side, from the
 * EFFECTIVE (override-resolved) `sweep_include_cached`/`auto_gc` settings —
 * `api/vault_api/routers/schedule.py`'s own docstring says a UI can render
 * it "without re-deriving the two settings' interaction itself". This
 * module takes that at face value: neither function below recomputes the
 * condition from the two settings again. Two call sites computing the same
 * domain predicate WILL diverge (docs/LEARNINGS.md, WP 4c-api/WP 4d) — the
 * fix here is not "get the client copy right", it is "have only one copy".
 *
 * **Review round 1 (Opus) FAIL, both blockers the same lesson: a field's
 * VALUE is not a description of the world.** `sweep_cached_gc_risk === true`
 * describes a CONFIGURATION (`sweep_include_cached` on, `auto_gc` not
 * `execute`) — it says nothing about whether the scheduler is even enabled,
 * so wording it as present-tense activity ("cached games ARE BEING
 * refreshed") over-claims whenever there is no schedule window (the shipped
 * default). `last_sweep_targets === null` describes an ABSENCE of a
 * recorded result, which has two different causes
 * (`api/vault_api/scheduler.py::claim_sweep` stamps `last_sweep_at` and
 * NULLs both counters in the SAME statement; `finish_sweep` fills them in
 * only once the sweep actually finishes) — `last_sweep_at` being present or
 * absent is what tells the two apart, and the fix round below is what makes
 * this module read that field instead of assuming "null counters" only ever
 * means "never ran".
 *
 * `last_sweep_targets` now carries THREE states that must never share
 * wording: `last_sweep_at` also null means the scheduler has never claimed
 * a sweep at all; `last_sweep_at` stamped but the counters still null means
 * a sweep STARTED and has not recorded a result — genuinely either still
 * running or the process died mid-sweep, per
 * `api/vault_api/routers/schedule.py`'s own field docstring ("Both null
 * while a sweep is in flight, or if the process died during one") — this
 * module states both remaining possibilities and picks neither; `0` means
 * it HAS run and found nothing to check. Neither the zero-targets branch
 * nor any other branch below names a CAUSE for an empty target set — at the
 * time this module was written, that could mean "no PC agent has ever
 * reported installed games" alone, but a sibling package changes the
 * sweep's default target set to also include cached-but-unreported games,
 * which makes any single hardcoded cause wrong the moment it lands. Only
 * observable possibilities are offered, never a diagnosis, and no default
 * value for any setting is ever stated here — the caller must pass the
 * server's own effective values (already true for `sweep_include_cached`,
 * surfaced by the Settings view's own toggle) rather than this module
 * guessing at what is "normally" on or off.
