 * Which job (if any) drives THIS app's detail-sheet job-control section, and
 * which of pause/resume/cancel apply to it (WP 4a.4 brief: "pause/resume/
 * cancel for the app's live job, downloads.js semantics/gating: pause
 * prefill-only").
 *
 * Ported from the Android sibling's `ui/detail/logic/DetailJob.kt` (WP 4b.6)
 * — deliberately BROADER than `lib/game-status.js`'s `findLiveJob`: that
 * helper excludes `queued` on purpose because the Library grid card mirrors
 * the mockup's pill (a queued job has no card-level affordance — it shows in
 * the Downloads FIFO queue instead). The detail sheet is a different
 * surface: it mirrors `lib/job-partition.js`'s job-control gating
 * (api/README.md "Job control" table), which DOES offer Cancel on a queued
 * job. A second, differently-scoped helper is therefore correct here, not a
 * duplicate of the grid's.
 *
 * GC jobs are excluded from `findTrackedJob` — pause/resume are meaningless
 * on a GC job (api/README.md job control table: pause on a GC job is
 * `409`), and this sheet's OWN GC action already owns any GC job IT starts,
 * via `lib/gc-flow.js`, independent of this job-control section.
 *
 * Pure — no DOM, no fetch. Covered in web/tests/detail-job.test.js.
