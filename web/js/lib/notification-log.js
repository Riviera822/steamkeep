/**
 * Notification log — read/unread lifecycle + navigate-target mapping
 * (WP 4a.7).
 *
 * This module deliberately does NOT diff anything itself. It consumes the
 * event objects `web/js/notifications.js` already produces on the polling
 * store's `"notifications"` channel (store.js, WP 4a.2/4a.3) — "consume,
 * don't reimplement" per this WP's brief. Its only job is turning that flat
 * event stream into the bell panel's list: newest-first, read/unread, and
 * "where does tapping this row go" (docs/design/vault-app-mockup-NOTES.md
 * round 6, "Notifications lead somewhere").
 *
 * **Persistence: session-only, in-memory (round-6 finding, decided here).**
 * The NOTES are silent on localStorage vs. session-only for the real app —
 * round 5's "no server-held notification store" only rules out a SERVER
 * side store, it says nothing about the browser tab surviving a reload.
 * This WP chooses session-only: a log surviving a reload would need its own
 * staleness/eviction story (is a three-day-old "download finished" toast
 * still useful context, or noise?) that no round of the mockup design work
 * ever worked through, and shipping persistence silently would be exactly
 * the kind of undocumented assumption docs/LEARNINGS.md's testing-discipline
 * section warns about. The log (and its `nextId` counter) lives in
 * `web/js/components/notifications.js`'s module-level state and is empty
 * again on every page load — revisit with an explicit decision if a
 * cross-reload log is ever wanted.
 *
 * **Why the log never seeds from current state, unlike the mockup's
 * `seedNotes()`.** The mockup fabricates an initial notification list from
 * whatever the demo data already looks like when it boots. This module
 * takes an intentionally narrower, more honest position: `notifications.js`
 * (the differ) fires nothing for state that was already true before the
 * app's first poll ("first-poll-silent", pinned in
 * web/tests/notifications.test.js) — reproducing the mockup's seeding here
 * would mean re-deriving "is this actually news" for already-true
 * conditions a second time, in a different module, with different rules.
 * The bell panel therefore legitimately starts empty and fills in as real
 * transitions happen after the app is open — contrast this with
 * `web/js/lib/bypass-banner.js`'s `bypassBannerVisible`, which is a live
 * snapshot predicate for exactly this reason (a persistent banner DOES need
 * to reflect "already true" state; a change LOG does not).
 *
 * Pure only — no DOM, no fetch, no clock reads (the caller supplies `at`,
 * an ISO-8601 string compatible with `lib/format.js`'s `formatTimestamp`,
 * and `startId`, the next free identifier). Covered in
 * web/tests/notification-log.test.js.
