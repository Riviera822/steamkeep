/**
 * Library search + filter-chip logic (WP 4a.3).
 *
 * Ports the mockup's `matchQ`/`FILTERS`/`renderChips` (docs/design/
 * vault-app-mockup.html, docs/design/vault-app-mockup-NOTES.md "Search"):
 * search and chips are ANDed, chip counts always describe what the grid
 * would show right now, case-insensitive substring match on the title. Pure
 * — no DOM — so the AND semantics and the counts are directly unit-testable
 * (web/tests/library-filters.test.js).
 *
 * Chip set DIFFERS from the mockup's, not merely "narrower": **`Failed`
 * REPLACES `Update ready`** (it is not simply dropped and not simply
 * added). The mockup's five chips are All/Cached/Not cached/Downloading/
 * Update ready; this WP ships All/Cached/Not cached/Downloading/Failed.
 * Two independent reasons meet here:
 *   1. There is nothing to show `Update ready` FOR — the real
 *      `GET /v1/games` has no stale/oracle field yet (game-status.js's
 *      module header, Divergence 1; api/README.md explicitly defers this
 *      to "a Phase-4 decision to make once the UI knows how it wants to
 *      render it").
 *   2. There IS something real to show instead — a persistent per-app
 *      `status: "error"` is genuine, currently-shipping API surface
 *      (apps.status stays `error` until a re-prefill succeeds,
 *      api/README.md "Per-game deletion") that the mockup never modeled at
 *      all (its own "error" only ever lived on a finished JOBS row, never
 *      on a GAMES row — see game-status.js's `statusAction` docstring).
 *      Leaving it with no chip and no filter would be a real, silent gap.
 * This is a deliberate, orchestrator-confirmed decision (see
 * docs/WORKPACKAGES.md's WP 4a.3 divergence record), not a placeholder —
 * `Update ready` returns as a SIXTH chip, not a swapped-back one, on
 * whatever WP first surfaces oracle staleness on `GET /v1/games`.
