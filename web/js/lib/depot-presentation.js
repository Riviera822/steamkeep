/**
 * Depot-sharing WORDING decision for the detail sheet (WP 4a.4 brief:
 * "Depots with computed sharing (holders/sole-holder/orphan wording)") —
 * presentation logic layered on top of `lib/multiplan.js`'s
 * `buildMultiPlan` arithmetic, which this sheet reuses AS-IS for a
 * single-id batch (`buildMultiPlan([appid], ...)`, mirroring the Android
 * sibling's `DetailController` kdoc) rather than re-deriving the
 * co-owner/holder computation a second time — the ADR-0003 guarantee ("a
 * shared depot with an outside cached holder is never counted as freed",
 * docs/design/vault-app-mockup-NOTES.md round 5 "Shared is a mapping fact;
 * kept is a cache-state fact") therefore applies here for free, already
 * proven in multiplan.test.js and pinned again for the single-id shape in
 * web/tests/depot-presentation.test.js.
 *
 * A `MultiPlanDepotRow`'s (`multiplan.js`'s row shape) `free` field answers
 * "if THIS app is deleted, does this depot lose its last cached holder" —
 * that is exactly "sole holder" WHEN this app itself currently holds the
 * depot (mockup round 5, "Shared · sole holder": cache-state truth leads
 * over mapping truth), but a DIFFERENT, rarer case when it does not:
 * mockup-notes.md's sample-data note seeds Meridian Rally/Tundra Protocol
 * scenarios so "a shared depot with no cached co-owner" can exist even
 * though the VIEWED game is not a holder either. `DEPOT_TAG` keeps those two
 * apart (`SOLE_HOLDER` vs `ORPHANED`) by taking `thisAppIsHolder` as an
 * explicit input, computed ONCE per detail (by the same
 * `hasProtectedCacheContent` predicate used for every OTHER co-owner in
 * `row.holderAppids` itself) rather than re-deriving it per depot row.
 *
 * **Recorded divergence (WP 4b.6, adopted here per this WP's brief):** the
 * depot-sharing presentation has a FOURTH state beyond the mockup's three —
 * `ORPHANED`, for a shared depot whose co-owning apps all have no cache
 * content (ADR-0003 last-remnant case). Collapsing it into "sole holder"
 * would state a falsehood (the viewed game holds nothing either).
 *
 * Ported from the Android sibling's `ui/detail/logic/DepotPresentation.kt`
 * (WP 4b.6) — same four states, same inputs, same reasoning.
 *
 * Pure — no DOM, no fetch. Covered in web/tests/depot-presentation.test.js.
