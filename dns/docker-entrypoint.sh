# SteamVault vault-dns container entrypoint (Phase 1, WP 1.9).
#
# Implements the placeholder contract dns/README.md defines for
# dns/dnsmasq.conf.template ("Placeholder contract"):
#
#   ${CACHE_IP}         required, NO default -- fail fast if unset
#   ${UPSTREAM_DNS_1}   optional, defaults to 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare)
#   ${UPSTREAM_DNS_2}   optional, defaults to 8.8.8.8 (Google)
#
# The defaults are supplied HERE, not in the template: envsubst has no
# "use this if unset" syntax, and dns/README.md explicitly makes the entrypoint
# responsible for exporting them. CACHE_IP deliberately gets no silent default --
# emitting `address=/steamcontent.com/` with an empty address would produce a
# dnsmasq config that either refuses to start or, worse, starts and answers
# nothing useful while looking healthy.
#
# All three values are substituted VERBATIM into a config file, so each is
# validated as a plain dotted-quad IPv4 address first. That is not paranoia
# theatre: a value containing a newline could inject arbitrary dnsmasq
# directives (dnsmasq's config format is one directive per line), and an
# unvalidated CACHE_IP is operator input arriving via .env.
#
# IPv4 only, on purpose. CACHE_IP is the A-record answer for
# *.steamcontent.com; the whole point of this container (ADR-0001 req 6) is that
# AAAA must resolve to NODATA so IPv6-capable clients cannot bypass the cache.
# Accepting an IPv6 CACHE_IP would defeat that.
