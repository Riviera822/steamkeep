/**
 * Depot-sharing WORDING decision for the detail sheet (WP 4b.6 brief:
 * "Depots with computed sharing (holders/sole-holder/orphan wording)") --
 * presentation logic layered on top of `ui/library/logic/MultiPlan.kt`'s
 * [MultiPlanDepotRow] arithmetic, which this sheet reuses AS-IS for a
 * single-id batch (`buildMultiPlan(listOf(appid), ...)`,
 * `DetailController`'s kdoc) rather than re-deriving the co-owner/holder
 * computation a second time -- the ADR-0003 guarantee ("a shared depot with
 * an outside cached holder is never counted as freed",
 * docs/design/vault-app-mockup-NOTES.md round 5 "Shared is a mapping fact;
 * kept is a cache-state fact") therefore applies here for free, proven once
 * in `MultiPlanTest` and pinned again for the single-id shape in
 * `SingleGameDeletePlanTest`.
 *
 * `MultiPlanDepotRow.free` answers "if THIS app is deleted, does this depot
 * lose its last cached holder" -- that is exactly "sole holder" WHEN this
 * app itself currently holds the depot (mockup round 5, "Shared · sole
 * holder": cache-state truth leads over mapping truth), but a DIFFERENT,
 * rarer case when it does not: mockup-notes.md's sample-data note seeds
 * Meridian Rally as "a previously deleted game... mapping rows intact,
 * nothing on disk" specifically so "a shared depot with no cached co-owner"
 * exists even though the VIEWED game is not a holder either. [DepotShareTag]
 * keeps those two apart ([SOLE_HOLDER] vs [ORPHANED]) by taking
 * [thisAppIsHolder] as an explicit input, computed ONCE per detail (by the
 * same [dev.steamvault.app.ui.library.logic.hasProtectedCacheContent]
 * predicate used for every OTHER co-owner in [MultiPlanDepotRow.holderAppids]
 * itself) rather than re-deriving it per depot row.
 *
 * Pure -- no Compose, no network. Covered by `DepotPresentationTest`.
