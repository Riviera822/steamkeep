/**
 * Client-side notification differ (WP 4b.8) -- Kotlin port of
 * `web/js/notifications.js` onto the compact snapshot entries in
 * `NotificationSnapshot.kt`, per that file's kdoc for why the differ reads
 * the narrow entry types rather than the full API response shapes in
 * `net/model/`.
 *
 * Every function here is PURE (no fetch, no Android, no clock reads), same
 * posture as the web module, so the full taxonomy is unit-testable on the
 * plain JVM (`NotificationDifferTest`) -- including the two invariants the
 * web DoD calls out by name and this WP's brief repeats:
 *   - the FIRST poll (no previous snapshot at all) must never fire a
 *     notification storm for data that was already true before the app
 *     was ever installed;
 *   - a poll with no real change must produce zero events.
 *
 * **Divergence from the web port -- unrecognized PREVIOUS job status is
 * treated as "was active", not "was not active" (the WP brief: "the
 * Android improvement from 4b.5 (unknown statuses) applies where
 * relevant").** `ui/downloads/logic/JobPartition.kt`'s WP 4b.5 divergence
 * routes an unrecognized job status into History with a neutral
 * presentation instead of silently vanishing from every bucket the way
 * `web/js/lib/job-partition.js` does -- the underlying principle is "an
 * unrecognized value must not make real information about a job disappear
 * without a trace." The web notification differ's `wasActive` check
 * (`JOB_ACTIVE_STATUSES.has(prev.status)`) has the analogous gap: a job
 * whose PREVIOUS status was neither a known active status
 * (queued/running/paused) nor a known terminal one (done/error/cancelled)
 * -- a genuinely new status value this client has never seen, or a
 * corrupted one -- would be treated as `wasActive = false`, so a real
 * transition into `done`/`error` from that unrecognized status would be
 * silently swallowed instead of reported. This port closes that gap: an
 * unrecognized previous status counts as "was active" (same fail-toward-
 * reporting-real-news posture [JobPartition] already established for the
 * Downloads screen), so a job's genuine arrival at a terminal status is
 * never dropped just because its prior status was one this client's
 * [JOB_ACTIVE_STATUSES]/[JOB_TERMINAL_STATUSES] tables don't recognize yet.
 * This is an IMPROVEMENT over the web behaviour, not a behavioural
 * requirement carried over from it -- recorded here per the WP brief,
 * mirroring how `JobPartition.kt`'s own divergence is recorded.
 *
 * No analogous change was needed for [diffGames]/[diffClients]: both
 * already compare with plain equality against a single known value
 * (`"stale"` / `true`) rather than set membership, so an unrecognized
 * previous value is already treated as "not that value" by construction --
 * the same fail-safe outcome the jobs fix above had to be added for
 * explicitly.
