/**
 * Everything the clients sheet needs (WP 4b.10 brief) — same thin-glue
 * shape `ui/downloads/DownloadsController.kt` / `ui/detail/DetailController.kt`
 * document: state + suspend orchestration only, every DECISION delegates to
 * `ui/clients/logic/ClientsView.kt`'s pure functions.
 *
 * **Hoisted at `MainActivity` level, not owned by a single [dev.steamvault.app.ui.nav.Destination].**
 * `ui/nav/Destination.kt`'s kdoc (and `docs/WORKPACKAGES.md`'s Phase 4a
 * header, "Clients is a sheet, not a nav item") is binding for this WP too
 * — this class is therefore held the same way [dev.steamvault.app.ui.settings.SettingsController]
 * is (`MainActivity.clientsControllerState`), reachable from wherever the
 * sheet needs to be opened FROM (a Settings button, a bypass notification
 * tap) regardless of which bottom-nav destination happens to be showing
 * underneath it — mirroring exactly how `web/js/components/clients-sheet.js`
 * floats over whatever view is current.
 *
 * **Foreground-only, poll only while [isOpen] (WP brief; same constraint
 * every screen in this app has before WP 4b.8's WorkManager wiring, applied
 * here to a surface that is not even always visible).** `web/js/store.js`
 * polls `GET /v1/clients` unconditionally (its bypass banner and
 * notifications differ both need a live snapshot regardless of the sheet
 * being open) — this app has no persistent bypass banner (out of this WP's
 * scope; the WorkManager-based background differ already covers the
 * notification half via its own independent poll,
 * `notifications/NotificationPollWorker.kt`), so the ONLY consumer of a live
 * `GET /v1/clients` poll on this platform is the sheet itself, and polling
 * only while it is open is the honest, resource-respecting scope for this
 * WP rather than inventing an always-on foreground loop nothing else reads.

     * NOT "stay idle while closed" load-bearing logic (that case cannot
     * be observed: the loop is torn down before it could ever see
     * `isOpen == false`); it is a narrow defensive check against the
     * brief window between [close] flipping the flag and Compose actually
     * cancelling the effect on the next recomposition, so a fetch never
     * fires for a tick that lands in that gap.
