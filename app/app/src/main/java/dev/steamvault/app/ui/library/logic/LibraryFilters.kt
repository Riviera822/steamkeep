/**
 * Library search + filter-chip logic (WP 4b.4) — Kotlin port of
 * `web/js/lib/library-filters.js`'s `matchQ`/`FILTERS`/chip-count logic
 * (docs/design/vault-app-mockup.html, docs/design/vault-app-mockup-NOTES.md
 * "Search"): search and chips are ANDed, chip counts always describe what
 * the grid would show right now, case-insensitive substring match on the
 * title. Pure — no Compose, no network — so the AND semantics and the
 * counts are directly unit-testable (`LibraryFiltersTest`).
 *
 * Chip set matches the web port's recorded divergence (docs/WORKPACKAGES.md
 * Phase 4a header, "Failed-replaces-Update-ready"), for the identical
 * reason: `GameSummary` has no stale/oracle field yet (`GameStatus.kt`'s
 * kdoc, Divergence 1), while a persistent per-app `error` status is real,
 * currently-shipping surface the mockup never modeled. This is the SAME
 * decision already made and recorded for the web frontend, applied here
 * for consistency between the two clients rather than re-litigated per
 * platform — chips ship All / Cached / Not cached / Downloading / Failed.
 *
 * **String-resource rule, exception recorded (WP 4b.4 review fix; see
 * app/README.md's "String resources" conventions section, and
 * `BulkPlan.kt`'s kdoc for the same exception applied to that file).**
 * [FILTER_DEFS]'s `label` values are a verbatim, word-for-word port of
 * `web/js/lib/library-filters.js`'s own `FILTER_DEFS` labels and are kept
 * as Kotlin literals rather than `strings.xml` entries, on purpose, so the
 * chip-set contract can be diffed against the web source directly.
 * `LibraryFiltersTest`'s `chip set is exactly...` case pins the KEYS; the
 * LABELS are pinned by literal string-equality in
 * `chip set labels match the web port's FILTER_DEFS labels verbatim`
 * below — this is what qualifies them for the literal exception rather than
 * the general "static UI chrome belongs in resources" rule.
