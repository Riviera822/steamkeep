 * document: state + suspend orchestration only, every DECISION delegates to
 * `ui/detail/logic/` pure functions. Not an `androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel`
 * (same house pattern), held via `remember` in `LibraryScreen.kt` alongside
 * [dev.steamvault.app.ui.library.LibraryController] -- the sheet is only
 * ever opened from the Library grid, so it shares that screen's lifecycle
 * rather than getting its own.
 *
 * **Depot sharing is computed, never stored** (mockup-notes.md round 3).
 * [open] fetches `detail`/`mapping` ONCE and stores them as plain fields;
 * the actual sharing arithmetic (`buildMultiPlan`/`buildDepotPresentation`)
 * is re-derived by the Composable on every recomposition from those fields
 * PLUS the caller's LIVE `games`/`jobs` snapshots (`LibraryScreen.kt` passes
 * `LibraryController.games`/`.jobs` straight through) -- so a co-owner's
 * cache state changing on the next poll tick while the sheet stays open
 * updates the sharing wording without a second `GET /v1/games/{appid}`
 * round trip. See `GameDetailSheet.kt` for exactly where that
 * recomputation happens.
 *
 * `detail` and `mapping` are only ever assigned TOGETHER, after BOTH
 * `GET /v1/games/{appid}` and `GET /v1/mapping` succeed -- never one before
 * the other -- so `detail != null` is always a safe "everything this sheet
 * needs to compute a plan is loaded" signal for callers, with no window
 * where the depot list is visible but the mapping table backing its sharing
 * computation is still the empty-list default.
