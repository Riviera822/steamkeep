/**
 * The garbage-collection flow's state machine (WP 4b.6 brief: "GC flow
 * state machine (dry-run -> plan-shown -> executing -> done/error, incl.
 * cancellation mid-poll)"). A pure reducer over explicit events -- no
 * Compose, no coroutines, no network. `DetailController` is the only
 * caller, wrapping each transition around the real
 * `POST /v1/cache/{appid}/gc` / `GET /v1/jobs/{id}` calls.
 *
 * **The one guarantee this whole module exists to prove (WP brief): GC
 * EXECUTE is never sent without an explicit user confirm after a dry
 * run.** [reduceGcFlow] only ever produces [GcFlowState.RequestingExecute]
 * (the state `DetailController` gates its `POST .../gc {"execute":true}`
 * call on) in response to [GcFlowEvent.ConfirmExecute] fired FROM
 * [GcFlowState.ConfirmExecute] -- and [GcFlowState.ConfirmExecute] itself
 * is only reachable via [GcFlowEvent.RequestExecute] fired from
 * [GcFlowState.DryRunPlan], which is only reachable after a REAL dry-run
 * job (`gc_execute=false`, api/README.md "dry run is the default, in three
 * independent places") polled all the way to `done`. Every `when` branch
 * below that does not recognize its (state, event) pair returns the state
 * UNCHANGED -- there is no fallback branch that advances anything, so a
 * stray or out-of-order event (a double-tap, two button presses racing) can
 * only ever be a no-op, never a shortcut past the confirm gate.
 * `GcFlowStateMachineTest` pins the specific case the brief calls out by
 * name: firing [GcFlowEvent.ConfirmExecute] against [GcFlowState.Idle]
 * stays [GcFlowState.Idle] (and every other non-[GcFlowState.ConfirmExecute]
 * state does too).
 *
 * **Cancellation mid-poll.** A GC job can be cancelled by a DIFFERENT
 * client (`DELETE /v1/jobs/{id}` is not gated to any one caller,
 * api/README.md's job-control table) while this flow is polling either
 * run -- [reducePoll] maps a `cancelled` job status to [GcFlowState.Cancelled]
 * from BOTH [GcFlowState.PollingDryRun] and [GcFlowState.PollingExecute],
 * an honest terminal state distinct from [GcFlowState.Error] (nothing went
 * wrong; an operator action ended the job, same "cancelled is not a
 * failure" posture `ui/downloads/logic/JobPartition.kt` documents for the
 * prefill case).
