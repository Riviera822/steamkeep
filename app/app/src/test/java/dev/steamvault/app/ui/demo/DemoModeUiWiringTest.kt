     * `DemoModeBanner()` (no `if (demoMode)` at all) in `DownloadsScreen.kt`
     * still built green at 611/611: the count stayed exactly 1, so the

     * -- this WP's whole point is that the indicator is unconditionally
     * accurate, and "shows on a real vault too" is exactly the confusion
     * constraint 1 exists to prevent, just aimed the other way.
     *
     * Fixed by counting the GUARDED literal `if (demoMode) DemoModeBanner()`
     * for the "exactly one" requirement (round 3's other two defeats --
     * the extracted-helper and `LazyColumn { item { ... } }` shapes --
     * remain covered exactly as round 3 left them, unaffected by this
     * change), AND by separately asserting the bare, unguarded form never
     * appears at all: every `DemoModeBanner()` call in the file must be
     * part of the guarded literal, with no leftover unguarded occurrence.
     *
     * This version checks, per screen, FOUR things at once:
     * 1. Exactly ONE `DemoModeBanner()` call exists in the file at all
     *    (comments stripped) -- catches a second, badly-placed call.
     * 2. Exactly ONE of those is the GUARDED literal
     *    `if (demoMode) DemoModeBanner()` -- catches the guard itself
     *    being dropped, which (1) alone cannot see.
     * 3. The banner's nearest enclosing `@Composable fun NAME(...)` is
     *    literally [SCREENS]'s expected name for that file -- i.e. the
     *    screen's OWN top-level composable, never a helper (private or
     *    not) extracted for or around the banner call.
     * 4. The span from that top-level function's own `@Composable` to the
     *    banner call contains NONE of [SCROLLING_CONTAINER_TOKENS].
